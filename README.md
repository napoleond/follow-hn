#Follow HN

Follow HN is a Chrome extension for following HN users' comments. It injects 
unobtrusive links to follow/unfollow the author beside each comment, and builds 
a feed of recent comments from the users you follow along the right sidebar, 
which can be toggled in and out of view. The only server component to this is 
Chrome's app storage (to sync between browsers if you're using that feature) 
and the new HN Firebase API.

TODO:

 - cache feed locally instead of re-fetching every load
 - Collect some screenshots
 - Put together gh-pages
 - Submit to Chrome store
